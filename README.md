## 🤔 Why This Tool?

Ever wanted to write your name or a special number in your GitHub contribution graph but didn't know which days to contribute on? This tool solves that problem by:

1. Showing you a preview of how your pattern will look
2. Generating a list of specific dates when you need to make real contributions
3. Helping you plan your contribution pattern months in advance

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **🎨 Plan Your Pattern**
   - Choose the year you want to create the pattern in
   - Enter the text/numbers you want to appear (max 8 characters)
   - Preview how it will look in the contribution graph

2. **📊 Get Your Contribution Schedule**
   1. **⚡ Interactive Preview**: 
      - Hover over any colored cell in the pattern to see the exact date you need to contribute on
      - Each colored cell represents a day requiring contribution
   2. **💾 Export Full Schedule**: 
      - Click "Export" to get a markdown file with all required contribution dates
      - The file includes a complete day-by-day schedule organized in a table format
   
   <br>

   > **💡 Pro Tip**: Make the same number of contributions for each marked date to ensure a consistent pattern intensity. For example, if you choose to make 4 contributions on one date, maintain 4 contributions for all pattern dates.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- 🔧 This is a planning tool, not a graph modifier
- ✨ You still need to make real contributions on the specified dates
- 📌 Contributions must be made on the exact dates to create the pattern
- ⏳ Plan ahead - patterns might require several months of consistent contributions
